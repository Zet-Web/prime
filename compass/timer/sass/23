Whassup? It's 2Pac. Can you get away?Let me come swoop you up.[2Pac]
I know you got a man but he ain't gon' mind if I take you out.
[2Pac]
Let me take you to lunch.
I'll have you back before he even get home;
before anybody see.
[2Pac]
Pleeeeeease...

[2Pac]
Oh aight. What's wrong with your eye?
Why you got on glasses?
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Ever since I met ya I could beat depression
It's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Ain't bout no suckin and touchin, just harmless discussion
Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations -- would that be OK?
I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you
But anticipation of love makin
got you shakin when I'm standin near you
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
Now the picture's getten clearer all he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave, and you tell me keep my faith in God
I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone and find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you don't deserve it
I contemplate -- but in my heart I know you worth it
Tell me can you get away?
Ebony, can you get away?
C'mon.. let's go.. can you get away?
Can you get away?
[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
I know, I know
[girl]
And I can't get away
[2Pac]
Just for a little while love
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
I know it's hard but, can you get away?
[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
Let's go man, get up outta there
.. can you get away?
[girl]
And I can't get away
[2Pac]
Do you love him?
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
Do you love that man?
