Cruising down the street in my sixteen four, Jocking the freaks, clocking the dough Went to the park to get the scoop Knuckle-heads out there cold shooting some hoops A car pulls up who can it be A fresh el camino rolling kilo g He rolled down his window and he started to say It's all about making that G.T.A Cuz the boys in the hood are always hard You come talking the trash we'll pull your card Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit Don't quote me boy cuz i ain't said shit  hey old man Get the fuck out  Pump that beat Muthafucker say what?

[Verse 2] Donald B's in the place to give me the pace He said my man JD is on freebase The boy JD was a friend of mine Til I caught him in my car trying to steal an Alpine Chased him up the streets to call a truce The silly cluck head pulls out a deuce deuce Little did he know I had a loaded twelve gauge One sucker dead L.A. times front page Cuz the boys in the hood are always hard You come talking the trash we'll pull your card Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit Don't quote me boy cuz I ain't said shit [scratching] ("Yo, Leroy") [scratching] ("Beer drinkin', breath stinkin', sniffin' glue")

[Verse 3]
Bored as hell and i wanna get ill
So i went to a place where my homeboys chill
The fellas out there making that dollar
I pulled up in my six four impala
They greet me with a forty and i started drinking
And from the eight ball my breath started stinking
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before i left i hit the barcardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said something that made me mad
She said something that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave
She started talking shit, wouldn't you know
Reached back like a pimp slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So i threw a right cross cold knocked him out
Cuz the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking the trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me boy cuz i ain't said shit
[scratching] ("Who do you think you are, Mr. big stuff?")
[scratching] ("Rock this muthafucker like Three the Hard Way")
[Verse 4]
I'm rolling hard now under control
Then wrapped my six four around a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said "Oh brother"
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walking home i see the G ride
Now Cat is driving, Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beat for resisting arrest
He sock the pig in the head for ripping his Guess
Now G is caught for doing the crime
Fourth offense on the boy he'll do some time
Cuz the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking the trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me boy cuz i ain't said shit
[scratching] L.A. Playa
[scratching] Big Drum Beater
[Verse 5]
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellas causing a riot in the county jail
Two days later in the municipal court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
Disruption of the court said the judge
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge
Baliff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out "Fire," then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi
Police shot the girl but didn't hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder
Cuz the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking the trash will pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me boy cuz i ain't said shit
