Hey bro, take me away, give me some way... This life will'nt be gray, then we'll celebrate your next birthday,
Walking on the Broadway...just freeway...Meeting at the Street Barkley, I wasn't in the army, But i love you, My sweet Barbie, My work is so hardly.. I'love my Family...
So, i'm not angel, i agree... But i beloved with this tree...You always was so angry, Fucking Enemy,
Bloomy....Motherfucking told me...Baby call me...You can stolen me...Golden or pink? You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink....So shrink everything but the kitchen sink, nod's as good as a wink,
Soft drink.. little does one think... My brother will think, he can sing ... everything...I want and will be glad, if you will marrying, we always were in the paring,
Get out this fucking  wearing, remembering...
I'm sittin here hoping that we can find some way to kick it.


Could it be my destiny to be lonely?
And checkin for these hoochies that be on me cause they phony
But you was different -- I got no need to be suspicious
Cause I can tell -- my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
I'm sittin here hoping that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance and miss my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses when he ain't lookin, now your heart's tooken My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook Wanna take you there but you scared to follow, come see tomorrow Hoping I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care -- that someone's there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, no time to waste we can hook up at the store
Can you get away?



I see you remiscin and I hope you listenin
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you -- was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home, that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to the sucker
Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya -- but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows -- on who controls will it last, before I ask
I hope you see that I'm sincere, and even if you
stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up -- cause I believe in what we share
You're livin in prison and what he's givin can't compare
Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passion it be yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me can you get away?
