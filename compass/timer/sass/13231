[Verse Three: 2Pac]

I see you remiscin and I hope you listenin
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you -- was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home, that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to the sucker
Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya -- but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows -- on who controls will it last, before I ask
I hope you see that I'm sincere, and even if you
stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up -- cause I believe in what we share
You're livin in prison and what he's givin can't compare
Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passion it be yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me can you get away?


[Outro: 2Pac]

You ain't got to go through all this drama and this stress
with this old half a man, yaknowhatI'msayin?
I ain't tryin to put you in a position
where you gotta give up your lifestyle for everything
you need but now.. he ain't even takin care of you
He beatin on you and shit; look how you look
She motherfuckin wanna be with that nigga, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Shake that sucker to the left
Let me show you what this life is really about
YaknowhatI'msayin? You need to be on first class
Need to be goin to Hawaii, seein the world
Seein what this world got to offer you
Not goin to, yaknowhatI'msayin?
The emergency room, gettin stitches
cause this nigga done got jealous
Don't cry, it's all good
